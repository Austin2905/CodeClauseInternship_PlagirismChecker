# CodeClauseInternship_PlagirismChecker
The Plagiarism Checker project is a natural language processing (NLP) project that uses machine learning to detect plagiarism in text. The project takes two pieces of text as input: a suspected plagiarized text and a reference text. The project then uses a variety of NLP techniques to compare the two texts and determine the level of plagiarism.
